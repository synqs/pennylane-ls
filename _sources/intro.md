# Welcome to our examples on  quantum circuits and cold atoms

In this book we collect examples of how we can describe experiments in cold atoms with atomic circuits. We will extend this step-by-step and all contributions are welcome.

## Get started with the examples

Here, are the steps to get started with a simple jupyter notebook example:

1.) Install pennylane-ls with pip:

`pip install pennylane-ls`

2.) Create a user account on our quantum hardware simulator [qsimsim](https://qsimsim.synqs.org).

3.) Download one of the example notebooks.
4.) Create the `credentials.py` in the same directory as the. Its file content should be:

```
username = 'YOUR-USER-NAME' #Put here your username
password = 'YOUR-PASSWORD' #and the pwd
```
5.) Open the jupyter notebook and have fun.
6.) If something went wrong contact us, open an issue or contribute.
